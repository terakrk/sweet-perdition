According to the [Tate Museum,](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/c/cadavre-exquis-exquisite-corpse) an *exquisite corpse* is "a collaborative drawing approach first used by surrealist artists to create bizarre and intuitive drawings." Poppy Z. Brite's novel of the same name is told by several different characters, in first- and third-person points of view.

- Andrew Compton: A London necrophile who escapes prison by pretending to be dead and traveling to New Orleans

> I maintain that ideal victims are actually more similar than their murdering counterparts. An habitual killer needs a vivid personality, even if all that lies beneath the flash and scintillation is a howling emptiness. But even before his death, the victim is often more void than substance. 

- Jay Byrne: A serial killer in New Orleans

- Vinh Tran (Tran): Jay's would-be victim who is drawn to violence and leaves home after his father kicks him out when he finds letters from Tran's violent boyfriend.

- Luke Ransom: Tran's violent boyfriend who is also HIV positive. He has a pirate radio station, an alter ego and a lot of rage.

A little over halfway through (chapter 9), the perspectives start bleeding together, with Anthony (first-person) and Jay (third-person) "speaking" without clear breaks. It's a little chaotic and confusing at first. 

Themes of loneliness and isolation: Anthony and Jay "recognize" each other and fall in love; Jay's biggest fear is loneliness and Anthony recognizes him as someobe like himself. (Anthony has always felt like something different than other people, a monster, a mutation. Is this just serial killing or part of the queer experience?
