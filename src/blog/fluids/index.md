<figcaption> Image description: The cover of May Leitz's novel Fluids. There's a black background with a pink wide-open mouth, the word 'Fluids' in red lettering underneath it; the words 'May Leitz' are in yellow letters, pink and purple symbols for 'female'/'Venus' are interlocked together. Underneath are the words 'I can teach you how to like it' in white letters. On the far right is a purple knife. On top of that is a long list of trigger warnings: 'Eating Disorder, suicide, matricide, dismemberment, suffocation, abuse, rape, torture, incest.'</figcaption>

Horror writer May Leitz says she has "a penchant for the shocking and gross." While her debut novel *Fluids* certainly is those things, they're natural outgrowths of the characters' mindsets and needs. It makes absolute sense that they do the things they do, which is the true horror (and tragedy) of the book.

At the height of COVID lockdown, two isolated women connect on the Internet--Lauren, whose father has recently died of COVID, and Dahlia, a trans woman living in a deeply transphobic Oklahoma town. Despite the combined threat of the virus and meeting an Internet stranger in person, Lauren impulsively arrives to "rescue" Dahlia--and everything goes downhill from there.

I was already familiar with Leitz's work from her [YouTube channel Nyx Fears.](https://www.youtube.com/@nyxfears) There she often reviews horror and other types of extreme films--she's one of the few YouTubers who [covered the Disturbing Movie Iceberg](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuiZLHy4bhKW9Yg4toYcH0nX0ZTBsN0OD 'Nyx Fears: THE Disturbing Movie Iceberg/Tier List') who's seen most of the films on it. Naturally, I expected some nasty shit to happen in *Fluids*, and I was right.

But that nasty shit doesn't happen just to shock the audience. Dahlia's identity is in a period of transition, and she's been too busy surviving her transphobic town to decide who she wants to be. Unfortunately, Lauren is enamored with the *idea* of Dahlia and what she can mold Dahlia into. When Dahlia initiates a video chat but leaves her camera off, Lauren says:

> [W]hoever someone pretends to be is who they are. The vagueness isn't fear as much as it's authentic to who she is. She doesn't have a personality or an appearance. Not yet. Maybe I have to give her that.

Yet, Lauren's feelings are sympathetic (if fucked up) and Dahlia isn't helpless. (The first thing she does when Lauren shows up at her house with no warning is attempt to strangle her.) Both women are compelling characters; the insides of their heads are rich and interesting places to visit, even if we don't want to live there. Their depth makes the trigger-warnable content--perpetrated by *by* and *to* them--even more disturbing.

Just how disturbing that content is, I can't tell you. In fact, I can't tell you much about this book in good conscience, lest I spoil the fun. Suffice it to say, *Fluids* is by turns sweet, sad, funny, empowering (yes, really), and most importantly, disgusting. At a slim 186 pages, it's a quick read that gets its hooks in you immediately. Its material isn't for the faint of heart (or stomach), but this little book made May Leitz one of my favorite writers and I can't wait to read more of her work.
