<p>I watched <em>Soft and Quiet</em> under optimal conditions: knowing absolutely nothing about it. But it's a movie that I want to discuss.</p>
<p><em>Soft and Quiet</em> follows Emily, a second-grade teacher who's organized a meeting of like-minded women after school. And I do mean &quot;follows&quot;--the events unfurl in real time. Without skipping in time or to other places, there's no filter, no sense that someone has safely presented the story to us. It's just an hour and a half with these people and there's no way out.</p>
<p>While the journey is horrifying, it's not without humor--albeit a very dark kind. One of the women bemoans being passed over for a promotion because she's white. She also thinks it would be a good idea to film their ilicit behavior and freaks out whenever the slightest thing goes wrong.</p>
