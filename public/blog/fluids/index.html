            <p>Horror writer May Leitz says she has &quot;a penchant for the shocking and gross.&quot; While her debut novel <em>Fluids</em> certainly is those things, they're natural outgrowths of the characters' mindsets and needs. It makes absolute sense that they do the things they do, which is the true horror (and tragedy) of the book.</p>
<p>At the height of COVID lockdown, two isolated women connect on the Internet--Lauren, whose father has recently died of COVID, and Dahlia, a trans woman living in a deeply transphobic Oklahoma town. Despite the combined threat of the virus and meeting an Internet stranger in person, Lauren impulsively arrives to &quot;rescue&quot; Dahlia--and everything goes downhill from there.</p>
