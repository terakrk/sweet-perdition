<h1>Fluids Notes</h1>

<li>
<p>Opinions on whether violence and other extreme content is &quot;gratuitous&quot; are
always subjective. However, I didn't feel like Leitz was throwing a bunch of
shocking things at me to be edgy for edginess's sake. We spend enough time inthe minds of Lauren and Dahlia that their actions seem like natural outgrowths of their personalities and psychologies. What they do is often disgusting, but it's ultimately very sad--we can see why they do what they do, even if we don't agree with it and wish better for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even Lauren's feelings that she has &quot;rescued&quot; Dahlia, and that Dahlia belongs to her, are sympathetic and understandable (considering her isolation and self-loathing), while also being creepy red flags. We see this with Lauren early on, when Dahlia initiates a video chat but leaves her webcam off:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I consider the possibility that [Dahlia] isn't who she says she is. But I always remember, in the back of my mind, that whoever someone pretends to be is who they are. The vagueness isn't fear as much as it's authentic to who she is. She doesn't have a personality or an appearance. Not yet. Maybe I have to give her that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And even Dahlia's <em>own</em> sense that Lauren is her savior. While being sexually assaulted by a man she and Lauren are trying to rob, she thinks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know Lauren will launch upwards and rush over to me and save me any second. She's going to hit him in the head with something, and then that'll be it. She will hit him in the head one last time and that'll be enough to take him down. I know she's going to save me.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Although it is sad, it <em>is</em> a horror story, and a slim 186 pages. It's a quick read that gets its hooks in you immediately, even if the plot doesn't always make literal sense. (I'm not sure if Dahlia becomes a zombie at one point. I think not, but...) This confusion could be on me, though I don't think Lauren and Dahlia always know what's going on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's also darkly funny, too--like May Leitz herself in her YouTube videos.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I met him on Grindr. What a riot. I met and fucked a <em>fag</em> from Grindr. This is fabulous; I should probably put this up on the fridge. There are notches, and then there's this. I'm a genius. (Lauren)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I heard somewhere that when women have sex, they mostly want the story of how the romantic moment unfolded and not the actual physical act itself. While obviously, this is bullshit to anyone who owns a vibrator, I like to think of myself as a tome. (Lauren)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;There's something so magical and powerful about disappointing your parents.&quot; (Lauren)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It reminded me of Eric LaRocca's <em>Things Have Gotten Worse Since We Last
Spoke</em> --queer women meet up online, and they bring out the absolute worst in each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;I don't want to hook up, but I don't want to earn it. I don't deserve it; I can't afford it.&quot; (Lauren)</p>
</li>
</ul>
